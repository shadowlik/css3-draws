#CSS3 Draws

Hi, my name is Henrique and I'm addicted to [medium.com](http//:medium.com). One day while I was scrolling trough the frontend section I read a great article how she improve her frontend skills by drawing in CSS, unfortunately I can't find this article anymore, if anyone knows or read it please share the link with me.

With this exercise I'm trying to accomplish three things:
* HTML structure that flows according to the draw (Example: Head > Face > Eyes)
* Use the minimum possible and only CSS3 (I'll try not to use JS)
* Stick to the most realistc version possible


##Cartman

My first draw and don't ask me why, is Cartman from South Park. I'm not happy with the code yet, so I'm going to continue improving it.
